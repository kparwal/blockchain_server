Create message object with fields
	userid (autogenerated)
	fname, lname
	key_hash
	timestamp (autogenerated)
	pub_key
	vid_url
	timestamp2 (autogenerated)
First request, fill out everything but the last three fields
Second request, find first request object and complete last three fields with user information
Every time period (currently one day), write the merkle tree to the mongodb, write the root to btc, and store txid with merkle root in some datastore (either new mongo table or perhaps sqlite instance)
Pull in python blockchain library from coinspark
Search for merkle tree based on user provided information
