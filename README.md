	pub_key
	vid_url

2. First request, fill out everything but the last three fields
3. Second request, find first request object and complete last three fields with user information
4. Every time period (currently one day), write the merkle tree to the mongodb, write the root to btc, and store txid with merkle root in some datastore (either new mongo table or perhaps sqlite instance)

6. Search for merkle tree based on user provided information
